            <h2>Cheeto (Chicken)</h2>

            <img src="images/cheeto_cattree.jpg" alt="Orange cat hanging paws off a cat tower" width="400">

            <p>Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and tries to get outside every single day. If he isn’t causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat tree and sleeping. 
            
            Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.

            <h2>Milktea</h2>

            <img src="images/Main.jpg" alt="Milktea taking nap" width="200">

            <p>Milktea is a Scottish fold with a personality of a princess. She loves her veggies and refuses to eat anything dropped on the ground. She makes it clear when she has a demand of any sort by complaining in a loud, distinguished manner. If what she says could be translated, it probably would be, “This is atrocious, the water container has been empty for the 3rd time this week. I want to see the manager.”
            
            Despite her cuteness and royalty, she actually suffers from a genetic disorder intentionally brought upon by humans. I highly advise against keeping a Scottish fold because they are in constant pain when they reach around 2 years old. Cartilage accumulates around her paw joints and tail joints and it becomes painful for them to even walk. She is living evidence of human’s cruelty of breeding animals to look pretty while sacrificing the animals’ health.
